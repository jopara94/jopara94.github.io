# Pharmacy Flash Cards

A simple game of flash cards where the user tries to guess the generic drug name of a given brand drug name.

## Technologies

HTML, CSS(Flexbox), Javascript.

### Installation Instructions

Users will need to download all the files (index.html, styles.css, app.js, open_bottle.jpeg) in the repository and have them saved in the same folder in order to play this game. To open the game, open the index.html file in a web browser.

### Problems

As I was writing the game, I used the ```console.log()``` function to see if what I was doing was working, but I was continually running into problems with my DOM manipulation. I could not get the cards to change color when the correct answer was chosen, or when the mouse hovered over them. I was later able to overcome that obstacle. I also tried but was not successful in putting space between the divs that hold my answer cards evenly.

### Future Improvements/Additions/Modifications

Difficulty levels, more questions and randomized answer choices, modals at the start and end of the game, and a different version of the game where the user is matching words and/or phrases in a different language to their English translations.
